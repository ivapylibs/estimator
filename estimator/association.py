#=================================== association ===================================
"""!
@brief  Code base / API for performing association of multiple changing variables of
        the same type, over time.  Essentially defines a consistent ID to each
        variable.  

There needs to exist some scheme for scoring these variables to preserve their ID.
Attached to this implementation is a generic class for defining the variable
features that will support association over "time."

# ADD CODE. GET CORE FROM PUZZLE_SOLVER correspondences.
# NEEDS TO HAVE PREDICT, MEASURE, CORRECT, ADAPT.

# ADAPT SHOULD ALIGN VARIABLE AND FEATURE VECTOR AS BEST NEEDED.
# CORRECT PERFORMS CORRECTION IN FEATURE SPACE.
# I THINK ABOVE IS COMPATIBLE WITH HOW PUZZLE SOLVER DOES IT.
